# Project Specifications

The assignment requires as a group of four individuals you undertake to analyse, design, develop, test, and deliver a Java Application

Your developed application must demonstrate learning to date and your knowledge of Java programming to include the use of: 
* Arrays
* Methods
* Objects and Classes
* File Management
* Exception Handling

The application must serve a well-defined purpose. The purpose should be identified through analysis in application development. From analysis, identify and establish the user requirements; the functional and non-functional requirements for the system. 

Inspiration may be drawn from Entertainment, Education, News, Lifestyle, or Travel. Careful consideration bust be given to the Methodology applied, the Implementation and a Testing Strategy for the end product. 

In your designated groups generate, discuss, and share ideas. Design a suitable solution based on your requirements elicitation. Develop an outline test plan for your solution. 

This is an opportunity to revisit all topics covered to date in Java programming and in COM809. This is an opportunity to demonstrate as a team your shared knowledge - what you are capable of producing - an exercise in peer learning. 

In order to manage the development process, you will need to agree a development strategy such as Agile methodology. Notes are available in Blackboard. 

A communication system between group members will be required; as a suggestion, sign the group up to Trello. 

**As a guide:**
1. Fully document all aspects of the design process, using clear labelled and well-constructed plans, charts, tables, and preparation sheets. 
2. Identify the classes and objects for your software solution. 
3. Identify relationships between the classes using UML diagrams to further address the problem and its solution. Communicate your concepts. 
4. Implement the solution in Java incorporating testing. 

**Key criteria that the INDIVIDUAL TEAM MEMBERS must meet (75%):**
* Be responsible for at least one specified section of code in the final application
* Use a range of coding techniques.
* Ensure that your code is written in a professional style, including indentation, comments, and descriptive names.
* Be responsible for testing part of the Application.
* Play a part in the management of the development process

Groups should aim for the following targets: Progress should be demonstrated and logged in the report appendix:

**18 Nov** 
* Teams to meet for the first time
* Research possible application

**20 Nov** 
* Application to be decided upon
* Research to be complete
* First application designs presented in Preparation Sheets

**27 Nov**
* Working prototype

**4 Dec**
* Complete coding and testing

**14 Dec**
* Final version to be uploaded
* Upload of Code and User Guide
* Presentation

## Submission
1. **Project Zip File** - uploaded by one member of the group including all code for the Java Application (and indicate the authors)
2. **6 Page Report** - A document indicating the group name and team members as well as the theme and ideas of the application. Background on how the theme was arrived at including your design documentation and testing documentation should be included. Outstanding features of note and unique selling points should be hit on, as well as an account of team member involvement (Who did what? Design, Code, Test, Demo, and Present). The User Guide should include an instruction set on how to use the application. 
3. **Demonstration** - The demo and presentations will start on 14 December and go as late as 16 December. 

## Assessment Criteria
This coursework is 50% of the overall module mark. 

As a guide, the report document of this assignment will be assessed with consideration paid to: 
* Introduction and outline of team members 
* Development Methodology 
* Analysis of Requirements: marketplace, current trends, any niche opportunities identified 
* Design: Preparation Sheets, UML diagrams 
* Implementation: Suitable solution based on requirements 
* Testing Strategy    

As a guide, during your demonstration consideration will be paid to 
* Interpretation of user requirements 
* Suitability for purpose 
* Code structure / documentation 
* Additional features    

As a guide, during your presentation consideration will be paid to  
* Presentation slide quality - key facts highlighted 
* Presentation style, team delivery; was it a cohesive team effort? 
* Recap/overview on requirements, design, member involvement, final product 
* Future improvements 

The 25% team/group section must be clearly illustrated for marking purposes. The 75% individual section must be clearly illustrated for marking purposes.

## Marking Scheme
### Team/Group - 25%
* Report - 10%
* Presentation - 10%
* Demonstration - 5%

### Individual - 75%
* Individual UML Design - 4%
* Functionality of specified section of code - 16%
* Range of coding techniques - 20% - (Objects, Classes, Arrays Methods, File reading/writing, Exception Handling can all be incorporated)
* Ensure code is professional - 10% - (include indentation, comments, descriptive names, visibility modifiers)
* Test part of the application - 10%
* Part management of the development process - 5%
* Individual contribution to presentation - 5%
